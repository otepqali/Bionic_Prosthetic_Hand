# ArmOrQol
Building bionic hand which will be controlled by EMG signals from muscles

The Project ArmOrQol (Qol means hand in Kazakh) has been developed in the scope of NU Hardware Challenge in 2 months from the beginning by me and 4 fellows.

All of the parts were printed in 3D printer.

It consists of 4 motors where 3 of them where connected to the fingers and 1 to the wrist.

As the price of EMG sensors were high in the market we have constructed 2 EMG sensors by ourselves (1 for controlling fist and another for controlling wrist).

All the code was written in Arduino as we have used Arduino UNO.

We have demonstration videos which you can watch by following the link below.
